# Hackpad, first time making!

## What is this?
This is a macropad I designed with Hack Club.  
It's just the standard hackpad you can find the toturial to on blueprint.hackclub.com/hackpad, but it's my first big project combining different fields of engeneering!

## How I made it
I designed the PCB in KiCad.  
I designed the case in Fusion 360.  
The firmware is written in QMK.
